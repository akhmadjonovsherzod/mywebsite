## Problem

Retail businesses often struggle to gain actionable insights from disparate data sources. Sales, inventory and external factors like oil prices influence performance but remain unconnected in typical reports.

## Approach

- Cleaned and joined multi‑year datasets using **Pandas**
- Built DAX measures and interactive visuals in **Power BI**
- Explored seasonality, regional differences and product mix impacts

## Results

- Identified top 10% of SKUs driving ~60% of revenue
- Surfaced correlations between oil prices and seasonal sales peaks
- Delivered an executive dashboard with drill‑down capabilities
