Welcome to my new portfolio blog! ðŸŽ‰

I'll be sharing deep dives into data analytics, web development experiments, and lessons learned along my journey as a Business Informatics student. Expect technical writeâ€‘ups, project retrospectives and occasional musings on technology trends.

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to explore the projects section and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat!
